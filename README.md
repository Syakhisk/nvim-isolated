# Neovim Isolated Configuration

This repository contains an isolated Neovim configuration environment. It will not interfere with your existing Neovim configuration by using a separate set of environment variables such as `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, etc.

I used this for rewriting my Neovim configuration from scratch. I wanted to keep my existing configuration intact for work and other stuff.

Everything on the `./nvim/` is free to modified and deleted.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd nvim-isolated
```

2. **Activate the environment:**

```sh
source activate
```

3. **Open Neovim:**
```sh
nvim
```
